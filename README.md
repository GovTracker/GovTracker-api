# GovTracker-api

GovTracker is a website aimed at tracking each party's platform, and then tracking their record while they are in office.  GovTracker's goal is to bring transparency to Canadian politics so we can hold our elected officials responsible for their actions.

## About this repo

This GitHub repo will hold the backend code for GovTracker.  The backend technology stack is as follows:

* Django for models and user authentication
* Django-rest-framework for API views and serialization
* Other components as required.

### Note about discussions

Political discussions of any nature will not be tolerated here.  Use of this GitHub repo to discuss the code and track bugs is actively encouraged.  However, any discussion outside of that is not allowed here.  Leave the actual discussion about platforms for the actual GovTracker website.  Partisan discussions do not have their place here, nor on GovTracker.  Just the facts.
